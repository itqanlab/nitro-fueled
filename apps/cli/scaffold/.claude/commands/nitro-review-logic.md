# Business Logic Review Command

**Agent Integration**: This command is executed by the nitro-code-logic-reviewer agent as Phase 2 of the systematic triple review protocol.

**Purpose**: Universal business logic evaluation that identifies dummy data, placeholders, hardcoded implementations, and technical debt regardless of technology stack.

**Scoring**: This command contributes 35% weight to the overall review decision.

## Phase 1: Business Context Analysis

**Before reviewing business logic, understand the project context:**

1. **Project Domain Analysis**:
   - Analyze README, documentation, and project structure
   - Identify core business entities and workflows
   - Understand the intended user experience and value proposition
   - Determine if this is a library, application, service, or tool

2. **Implementation Stage Assessment**:
   - Development phase (MVP, feature development, production-ready)
   - Deployment environment (local, staging, production)
   - Integration requirements with external services
   - Data persistence and state management needs

## Phase 2: Universal Business Logic Principles

Apply these framework-agnostic principles to evaluate business value:

### 1. Dummy Data & Placeholder Detection

**Identify production-inappropriate content:**

- Hardcoded test values, sample data, or mock responses
- Placeholder text (Lorem ipsum, "TODO", "FIXME", generic names)
- Development-only configuration leaking into production logic
- Commented-out business logic or temporary workarounds
- Sample/default credentials or API keys

### 2. Hardcoded Implementation Patterns

**Find overly rigid or inflexible code:**

- Business rules embedded directly in presentation logic
- Magic numbers and strings without configuration options
- Hardcoded file paths, URLs, or endpoint configurations
- Fixed assumptions about data formats or external service responses
- Non-configurable business workflows or validation rules

### 3. Business Value Alignment

**Evaluate implementation against intended purpose:**

- Core functionality completeness relative to stated requirements
- User experience considerations and edge case handling
- Performance characteristics appropriate for expected usage
- Scalability considerations for anticipated growth
- Integration patterns suitable for the business domain

### 4. Technical Debt & Shortcuts

**Identify maintenance and scalability risks:**

- TODO items without clear ownership or timelines
- Temporary solutions that should be permanent implementations
- Copy-pasted business logic that should be abstracted
- Missing error handling for critical business operations
- Insufficient logging or monitoring for business-critical paths

### 5. Data Integrity & Business Rules

**Ensure business logic robustness:**

- Input validation appropriate for business context
- Business rule enforcement at appropriate architectural layers
- Data consistency and transaction boundary considerations
- Audit trail and change tracking for critical business data
- Appropriate handling of business exceptions and edge cases

## Phase 3: Domain-Specific Evaluation

**Adapt analysis based on detected project domain:**

## Review Process

### Step 1: Domain Context Analysis

```markdown
## Business Context Analysis

**Project Domain**: [AI development tools, content management, API service, etc.]
**Primary Business Entities**: [Agent, Workflow, Task, Project, etc.]
**Core Workflows**: [orchestration, code generation, task tracking, etc.]
**Implementation Stage**: [MVP, feature development, production-ready]
**External Dependencies**: [LLM providers, databases, APIs, etc.]
```

### Step 2: Business Logic Assessment

For each file containing business logic:

- Identify core business operations and their implementations
- Check for placeholder data or temporary implementations
- Evaluate business rule enforcement and validation
- Assess error handling for business-critical operations
- Review configuration management and flexibility

### Step 3: Production Readiness Evaluation

- Verify all dummy data has been replaced with real implementations
- Confirm business rules are properly configurable
- Check logging and monitoring coverage for business operations
- Validate error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Assess scalability and performance characteristics

## Required Analysis Areas

### 1. Configuration Management

- Environment-specific settings properly externalized
- Business rules configurable without code changes
- Feature flags and A/B testing capabilities where appropriate
- API endpoints and integration configurations externalized

### 2. Business Rule Implementation

- Validation logic appropriate for business context
- Business rules enforced at correct architectural boundaries
- Error messages and user feedback appropriate for business domain
- Audit trails and change tracking for critical operations

### 3. Data Management

- Business entity relationships properly modeled
- Data validation appropriate for business requirements
- Transaction boundaries aligned with business operations
- Data migration and schema evolution considerations

### 4. Integration Patterns

- External service integration appropriate for business needs
- Error handling and retry logic for business-critical integrations
- Data synchronization patterns suitable for business requirements
- API design aligned with business domain concepts

## Subtask Generation Protocol

**For each business logic issue identified, generate actionable subtasks:**

### High Priority Subtasks (Blocking Production)

- Replace dummy data with real business logic implementations
- Remove hardcoded configuration that prevents environment flexibility
- Implement missing error handling for critical business operations
- Fix business rule violations or incomplete implementations

### Medium Priority Subtasks (Improve Business Value)

- Extract hardcoded business rules to configurable systems
- Implement missing edge case handling for business operations
- Add appropriate logging and monitoring for business metrics
- Refactor duplicated business logic into reusable components

### Low Priority Subtasks (Technical Debt)

- Document business logic and decision rationale
- Add comprehensive testing for business rule edge cases
- Optimize performance for business-critical operations
- Improve error messages and user experience feedback

## Scoring Guidelines

**Score Range**: 1-10 (contributes 35% to overall review score)

- **9-10**: Production Ready - All business logic complete, no dummy data, flexible and configurable
- **8-8.9**: Near Production Ready - Minor configuration or edge case improvements needed
- **7-7.9**: Feature Complete - Core business logic solid, some flexibility improvements needed
- **6-6.9**: Functional - Basic business requirements met, significant improvements needed
- **5-5.9**: Incomplete - Major business logic gaps or extensive dummy data present
