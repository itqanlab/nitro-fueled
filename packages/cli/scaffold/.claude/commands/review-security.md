# Security Review Command

**Agent Integration**: This command is executed by the code-reviewer agent as Phase 3 of the systematic triple review protocol.

**Purpose**: Universal security vulnerability assessment that identifies potential security issues across any technology stack and deployment environment.

**Scoring**: This command contributes 25% weight to the overall review decision.

## Phase 1: Security Context Analysis

**Before reviewing security, understand the threat landscape:**

1. **Application Type & Attack Surface**:
   - Web application, API service, desktop app, mobile app, or library
   - Public-facing vs internal/private deployment
   - Authentication requirements and user data handling
   - Integration with external services and data sources

2. **Technology Stack Security Profile**:
   - Language-specific security considerations
   - Framework-specific vulnerability patterns
   - Database and storage security requirements
   - Deployment environment and infrastructure security

## Phase 2: Universal Security Principles

Apply these technology-agnostic security assessments:

### 1. Credential & Secret Management

**Critical security exposures to identify:**

- Hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens, or certificates
- Database connection strings with embedded credentials
- Cloud service keys and access tokens in source code
- Encryption keys or salts stored in plain text
- Development/test credentials used in production code
- Default passwords or well-known secret values

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Data integrity and injection prevention:**

- SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) risks in user input handling
- Command injection through system calls or shell execution
- Path traversal vulnerabilities in file operations
- Deserialization of untrusted data
- Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

**Access control security assessment:**

- Authentication bypass opportunities
- Session management vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation possibilities
- JWT token security (if applicable)
- Password storage and hashing practices
- Multi-factor authentication implementation gaps

### 4. Data Protection & Privacy

**Sensitive information handling:**

- Personal data exposure in logs or error messages
- Sensitive data transmission without encryption
- Improper data storage or caching of sensitive information
- Data leakage through API responses or debugging information
- Inadequate data retention and deletion practices
- Cross-tenant data access in multi-tenant applications

### 5. Network Security & Communications

**Transmission and communication security:**

- Unencrypted communications (HTTP instead of HTTPS)
- Certificate validation bypassing
- Insecure TLS/SSL configuration
- CORS misconfiguration allowing unauthorized origins
- Missing security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- WebSocket security considerations

### 6. Business Logic Security

**Application-specific security flaws:**

- Race condition vulnerabilities in critical operations
- Business rule bypasses through parameter manipulation
- Insufficient rate limiting on sensitive operations
- Time-of-check vs time-of-use vulnerabilities
- State manipulation vulnerabilities
- Logic flaws that could lead to privilege escalation

## Phase 3: Technology-Specific Security Patterns

**Adapt security analysis based on detected technology stack:**

### Web Applications

- **Frontend**: XSS prevention, Content Security Policy, secure cookie handling
- **Backend**: CSRF protection, request validation, secure session management
- **API**: Rate limiting, input validation, response data filtering

### Database Security

- **SQL Databases**: Parameterized queries, least privilege access, encryption at rest
- **NoSQL Databases**: Injection prevention, access control, data validation
- **ORM Security**: Proper query construction, relationship security, mass assignment protection

### Cloud & Container Security

- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: IAM configuration, resource access controls, encryption settings
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Container security, secrets management, network policies
- **Serverless**: Function permissions, environment variable security, execution context

### Electron Desktop Application Security

**CRITICAL - Electron-specific security checklist:**

- [ ] **contextIsolation** enabled in all BrowserWindow webPreferences
- [ ] **nodeIntegration** disabled in renderer processes
- [ ] No remote module usage
- [ ] **IPC channels** validated and sanitized (both main-to-renderer and renderer-to-main)
- [ ] No **shell.openExternal** with untrusted or unvalidated URLs
- [ ] **SQL parameterized queries** for SQLite (no string concatenation)
- [ ] No **eval()** or **Function()** with user input
- [ ] **CSP headers** configured in BrowserWindow webPreferences
- [ ] **Preload scripts** are minimal and scoped (expose only necessary APIs)
- [ ] **File system access** restricted and validated
- [ ] **webSecurity** not disabled in production
- [ ] **allowRunningInsecureContent** is false
- [ ] **Protocol handlers** registered securely (no custom protocol hijacking)
- [ ] **Auto-updater** uses signed packages and HTTPS
- [ ] **Native node modules** reviewed for security implications
- [ ] **LanceDB/SQLite** database files have proper file permissions
- [ ] **Sandbox** mode enabled where possible

### Language-Specific Security

- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Prototype pollution, dependency vulnerabilities, eval() usage
- **Python**: Pickle/deserialization, SQL injection, code injection
- **Java**: Deserialization vulnerabilities, XXE, path traversal
- **Go**: SQL injection, path traversal, goroutine security
- **Rust**: Unsafe code blocks, memory safety, concurrency issues
