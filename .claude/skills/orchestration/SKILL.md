# Orchestration Skill

Multi-phase development workflow orchestration with dynamic strategies and user validation checkpoints. **You are the orchestrator** - coordinate agents, manage state, verify deliverables.

## Quick Start

```
/orchestrate [task description]     # New task
/orchestrate TASK_2026_XXX          # Continue existing task
```

### Strategy Quick Reference

| Task Type     | Strategy Flow                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| FEATURE       | PM -> [Research] -> Architect -> Team-Leader -> QA |
| BUGFIX        | [Research] -> Team-Leader -> QA                    |
| REFACTORING   | Architect -> Team-Leader -> QA                     |
| DOCUMENTATION | PM -> Developer -> Style Reviewer                  |
| RESEARCH      | Researcher -> [conditional implementation]         |
| DEVOPS        | PM -> Architect -> DevOps Engineer -> QA           |
| CREATIVE      | [ui-ux-designer] -> content-writer -> frontend     |

See [strategies.md](references/strategies.md) for detailed flow diagrams.

## Your Role: Orchestrator

**CRITICAL**: You are the **orchestrator**, NOT the implementer.

### Primary Responsibilities

1. **Delegate to Specialist Agents** - Use Task tool to invoke specialists
2. **Coordinate Workflows** - Manage flow between agents, handle checkpoints
3. **Verify Quality** - Ensure agents complete tasks correctly
4. **Never Implement Directly** - Avoid writing code yourself

### When to Delegate (ALWAYS)

| Task Type      | Agent(s)                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Writing code   | backend-developer, frontend-developer                     |
| Testing        | senior-tester                                             |
| Code review    | code-style-reviewer, code-logic-reviewer, visual-reviewer |
| Research       | researcher-expert                                         |
| Architecture   | software-architect                                        |
| Planning       | project-manager                                           |
| Infrastructure | devops-engineer                                           |

**Default**: When in doubt, delegate. See [agent-catalog.md](references/agent-catalog.md) for all 14 agents.

## Workflow Selection Matrix

### Task Type Detection

| Keywords Present                              | Task Type     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| CI/CD, pipeline, Electron Forge, deploy, pack | DEVOPS        |
| landing page, marketing, brand, visual        | CREATIVE      |
| implement, add, create, build                 | FEATURE       |
| fix, bug, error, issue                        | BUGFIX        |
| refactor, improve, optimize                   | REFACTORING   |
| document, readme, comment                     | DOCUMENTATION |
| research, investigate, analyze                | RESEARCH      |

**Priority**: DEVOPS > CREATIVE > FEATURE (when multiple keywords present)

### Adaptive Strategy Selection

When analyzing a task, evaluate multiple factors:

| Factor          | Weight | How to Assess                              |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Keywords        | 30%    | Match request against keyword table above  |
| Affected Files  | 25%    | Identify likely affected code paths        |
| Complexity      | 25%    | Simple (<2h), Medium (2-8h), Complex (>8h) |
| Recent Patterns | 20%    | Check last 5 tasks in registry.md          |

**Decision Rules**:

- Top strategy confidence >= 70%: Proceed with that strategy
- Top two strategies within 10 points: Present options to user
- All strategies < 70%: Ask user for clarification

See [strategies.md](references/strategies.md) for detailed selection guidance.

## Core Orchestration Loop

### Mode Detection

```
if ($ARGUMENTS matches /^TASK_2026_\d{3}$/)
    -> CONTINUATION mode (resume existing task)
else
    -> NEW_TASK mode (create new task)
```

### NEW_TASK: Initialization

1. **Read Registry**: `Read(task-tracking/registry.md)` - find highest TASK_ID, increment
2. **Create Task Folder**: `mkdir task-tracking/TASK_[ID]`
3. **Create Context**: `Write(task-tracking/TASK_[ID]/context.md)` with user intent, strategy
4. **Announce**: Present task ID, type, complexity, planned agent sequence

### CONTINUATION: Phase Detection

| Documents Present       | Next Action                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| context.md only         | Invoke project-manager              |
| task-description.md     | User validate OR invoke architect   |
| implementation-plan.md  | User validate OR team-leader MODE 1 |
| tasks.md (PENDING)      | Team-leader MODE 2 (assign batch)   |
| tasks.md (IN PROGRESS)  | Team-leader MODE 2 (verify)         |
| tasks.md (IMPLEMENTED)  | Team-leader MODE 2 (commit)         |
| tasks.md (all COMPLETE) | Team-leader MODE 3 OR QA choice     |
| future-enhancements.md  | Workflow complete                   |

See [task-tracking.md](references/task-tracking.md) for full phase detection.

### Agent Invocation Pattern

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: '[agent-name]',
  description: '[Brief description] for TASK_[ID]',
  prompt: `You are [agent-name] for TASK_[ID].

**Task Folder**: [absolute path]
**User Request**: "[original request]"

[Agent-specific instructions]
See [agent-name].md for detailed instructions.`,
});
```

---

## Validation Checkpoints

After PM or Architect deliverables, present to user:

```
USER VALIDATION CHECKPOINT - TASK_[ID]
[Summary of deliverable]
Reply "APPROVED" to proceed OR provide feedback for revision
```

See [checkpoints.md](references/checkpoints.md) for all checkpoint templates.

---

## Team-Leader Integration

The team-leader operates in 3 modes:

| Mode   | When                    | Purpose                            |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| MODE 1 | After architect         | Create tasks.md with batched tasks |
| MODE 2 | After developer returns | Verify, commit, assign next batch  |
| MODE 3 | All batches COMPLETE    | Final verification, summary        |

### Response Handling

| Team-Leader Says     | Your Action                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| NEXT BATCH ASSIGNED  | Invoke developer with provided prompt |
| BATCH REJECTED       | Re-invoke developer with issues       |
| ALL BATCHES COMPLETE | Invoke MODE 3                         |

See [team-leader-modes.md](references/team-leader-modes.md) for detailed integration.

## Flexible Invocation Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use                     | Flow                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Full    | New features, unclear scope     | PM -> Architect -> Team-Leader -> QA |
| Partial | Known requirements, refactoring | Architect -> Team-Leader -> QA       |
| Minimal | Simple fixes, quick reviews     | Single developer or reviewer         |

---

## Error Handling

### Validation Rejection

1. Parse feedback into actionable points
2. Re-invoke same agent with feedback
3. Present revised version

### Commit Hook Failure

**NEVER bypass hooks automatically.** Present options:

1. Fix issue (if related)
2. Bypass with --no-verify (if unrelated, with user approval)
3. Stop and report (if critical)

See [checkpoints.md](references/checkpoints.md) for error handling templates.

### Loading Protocol

1. **Always loaded**: This SKILL.md (when skill triggers)
2. **Load on demand**: References when specific guidance needed
3. **Never preload**: All references at once

---

## Completion Phase (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)

After the QA cycle (reviews + fixes + final commit), the orchestrator MUST complete ALL of these bookkeeping steps BEFORE the final commit. The completion report is the #1 most-skipped deliverable — if you skip it, the task is considered INCOMPLETE regardless of code quality.

**Commit order:**
1. First commit: implementation code (after dev, before QA)
2. Second commit: QA fixes
3. Third commit: completion bookkeeping (report + registry + plan update)

All three commits are REQUIRED. Do not combine them.

### 1. Write Completion Report

Write `task-tracking/TASK_[ID]/completion-report.md` with:

```markdown
# Completion Report — TASK_[ID]

## Files Created
- [path] ([LOC] lines)

## Files Modified
- [path] — [what changed]

## Review Scores
| Review | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Code Style | X/10 |
| Code Logic | X/10 |
| Security | X/10 |

## Findings Fixed
- [what each review caught, how resolved]

## New Review Lessons Added
- [what was appended to .claude/review-lessons/, or "none"]

## Integration Checklist
- [ ] Handlers registered in ipc-bootstrap.ts
- [ ] Channels whitelisted in preload.ts
- [ ] Barrel exports added
- [ ] Migrations wired in migration-runner

## Verification Commands
[grep/glob commands to confirm deliverables]
```

### 2. Update Registry

Update `task-tracking/registry.md` — set status to COMPLETED.

### 3. Update Implementation Plan

Add STATUS tag under the task's description in `docs/24-implementation-task-plan.md`:

```markdown
> **STATUS: COMPLETED** — [Summary of what was built, LOC, commit hash]. TASK_[ID].
```

### 4. Final Commit

Commit all bookkeeping changes with message: `docs: add TASK_[ID] completion bookkeeping`

---

## Key Principles

1. **You are the orchestrator**: Direct tool access, no agent overhead
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Load references only when needed
3. **User validation**: Always get approval for PM/Architect deliverables
4. **Team-leader loop**: 3-mode cycle handles all development coordination
5. **Never bypass hooks**: Always ask user before --no-verify
6. **Single task folder**: All work in parent task folder
7. **Review lessons**: Developers read lessons before coding, reviewers update lessons after reviewing
